Sports loyalty when at school was practically non existent, no one, apart from those on the teams, usually gave a shit about how the sports teams did. No yearbooks. No jackets. No proms - at least when I went to school, that aberration seems to be creeping in now - no one gives a fuck.

We had our ten year reunion last year in the school gymnasium, and there he was, with his sunglasses on at 8pm, sporting a sweet flavor saver and shorts, with his black socks pulled up to his knees. As was the fashion for all the \"Bros\" at my high school when we attended. He was making his rounds, trying to enforce every single rule that was imposed on students. Meanwhile, we are all 27-29 years old, and nobody is taking his shit. Eventually someone told him, \"You were a fucking tool in high school, and nothing has changed. Get lost, Narc.\" He then started listing every girl he \"boned\" in high school. It was hard watching that guy spiral so hard while everyone was laughing at him.</p>",

This guy looks like he's in his early thirties possibly late twenties, definitely at least 28. The worst part of this story is when his other friend butts in and says \"Is it really paying rent when you're just paying your mom to stay at her house?\" I am no expert, but I can tell he didn't know whether to be sad or angry about what his friend said. He was also probably trying to hide the fact that he still lived with his mom from his other friends.</p>",
