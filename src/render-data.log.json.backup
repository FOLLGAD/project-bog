As I was standing near him (he was sitting in his chair reading the file on his desk), I felt a sneeze come on. Knowing that I didn’t have time to grab a tissue, I just turned away from him. However, the sneeze held off but the gas in my stomach did not. I crop dusted the poor man. Embarrassed, I whipped my body back around to face him and the centripetal force of my motion must have knocked my sinuses loose. I sneezed upon completing the spin but was in too much shock to cover my face. I gave my boss both an aura of noxious odor and mucus spewed across his face.</p>",

Too busy being \"punk rock\" and making just enough for a roof and partying. Paradise.</p>\n<p>One week in, I go to a show, get completely shithoused, and stumble back up the hill to either get more fucked up, or pass out at home. I decide to stop at the 7-11 directly across from my building, ya know.. Snacks. I grab everything my impulses and lack of inhibition tells me to and im about to pay for this garbage and be on my way. Set my things on the counter and politely introduce myself to the cashier, as she is ringing up my last couple things, without any kind of warning or rumbling before hand, i am in excruciating pain, right in my gut. A split second flashes by, I clutch and clench my legs together. I gasped \"bathroom\"? To her. It was too late 5 seconds ago.. I try to take a step and bam! My bowels unleash with not only an ungodly sound from my ass, but a simultaneous yelp as if I were a chihuahua that had just been stomped on. I swear I have never been so suddenly sober without a cop being involved. I have shorts on, i look down, and just liquid shit down the back of my leg, into my boots, and starting to puddle on the floor.</p>\n<p>I just ran. No change. No Snacks. No words. I lived at that spot for almost 2 years. Never went back, and never even walked across their lot to get anywhere. I would walk the same way around that place to avoid it every day.</p>\n<p>I feel terrible.</p>",

			"body_html": "<p>When I was much younger, about 9-10, I went to a large PC store with my Dad, who wanted to ask a technician about an upgrade. Before we left the house my Dad asked if I needed the toilet first, which I said no to. Predictably, on the way I started feeling like I needed to pee, but knowing that I had only 5 minutes earlier told my Dad I didn’t need to go, I said nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We got stuck in traffic for about 30 minutes and the need was becoming urgent. But I thought to myself I’m a big boy now, I can handle this, I’ll just go behind the store when we get there.</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>So when we pull up I pretend to my Dad that I’m going to look at the games at the front of the store and he could find me there when he was done, so he walked off to the back of the store where the technicians desk was. I took my chance and snuck out to execute my master plan. Little did I know that the rear car park of the retail centre was being used for some sort of event, I don’t recall what it was but I just remember a lot of people standing around talking and singing. So I abandoned my attempt and returned to the store. I was at the point of bouncing on the spot to keep it in. One lapse in concentration and it was game over.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I returned to the games section and was walking up and down frantically, pretending to browse when all I was really doing was trying not to piss myself. Clearly I was acting strangely, and this lead to the security guard coming over to see if I was ok. Except when he arrived he turned the corner just as I was coming to the end of the aisle, and we basically ran straight into each other. The brief moment of shock was all it took to break my piss holding-zen.</p>\n<p>It started as a couple of hot drips that just soaked the front of my underwear, but the seal was now broken, and no matter what I did, there was nothing that could stop the tsunami of warm amber that was now streaming down both of my legs. I could do nothing but stand there, and started crying hysterically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Safe to say that when my Dad heard this and came running, he decided that he would not be making a purchase that day, and to this day I have never set foot in that store again.</p>\n<p>TL:DR. Pissed myself in the middle of a store in front of the security guard. Dad did not buy a new PC.</p>",

As she's starting I start to sweat. Now sometimes when I was younger my head would get really hot and my head would sweat when I was in put on the spot sometimes (anxiety I guess, no idea, but it's mostly gone away thankfully). Usually a few drops of sweat will roll down my face when this happens, but not today.<br>\n It was like someone was standing over me slowly pouring a bottle of water slowly over my head. &nbsp;It just kept going and going. Eventually the girl mentions \"wow, you must be really hot\". I'm already very nervous, and blurt out the first thing that pops into my head, \"ya, it must be because you're pretty. I'm not sure why this is happening, you're pretty but it's not like you're <em>that</em> pretty\".<br>\n So pretty much as soon as the last words are leaving my mouth I start asking myself, why in gods name would you say that. Now I'm even more embarrassed and I have to sit through a haircut feeling like an idiot, a drippy wet idiot.<br>\n I spent the rest of the haircut praying for it to be done quickly or for a meteor to come through the ceiling and put me out of my misery. &nbsp;The girl handled the rest of the haircut like a god damn pro, no idea why she didn't just kick me out. She finished, I paid, gave her a huge tip, and now I drive farther to get my haircut done somewhere else.</p>",
