<p class="text"><span id="3" class="hide body">When I was a student I met my future wife. </span><span id="4" class="hide body">Shortly after graduation we married. </span><span id="5" class="hide body">Everything was fine, </span><span id="6" class="hide body">we have had a happy life, </span><span id="7" class="hide body">two beautiful daughters and me as an Diplome engineer in the country of engineers (Germany) had a very decent income. </span><span id="8" class="hide body">When I got a promotion and was in charge of the business in 13 countries (we even moved to another country for the doubled income) , </span><span id="9" class="hide body">my wife started to act weirder. </span><span id="10" class="hide body">She started to spend money as hell,became more and more aggressive, </span><span id="11" class="hide body">violent and abusive. </span><span id="12" class="hide body">She started to hit and kick me when she was unhappy. </span><span id="13" class="hide body">It would have been a classic case of domestic violence if I wasn&apos;t a large and heavy man and she a small and light woman (authorities didn&apos;t care, </span><span id="14" class="hide body">police just laughed hard) . </span><span id="15" class="hide body">She even attacked me with a kitchen knive. &#xA0;</span><span id="16" class="hide body">But that was not even the worst....(police still laughing)&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="17" class="hide body">I relalised that when I wasn&apos;t at home, </span><span id="18" class="hide body">she did the same to our daughters (both below 6 years old). </span><span id="19" class="hide body">When I was on business trip she left the house and did not come back for days, </span><span id="20" class="hide body">leaving the kids alone. </span><span id="21" class="hide body">She just made sure that she was at home before I came back from the business trips to clean up the mess.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="22" class="hide body">When I came back from the business trip early I found my kids in their own mess, </span><span id="23" class="hide body">completely disturbed and crying from hunger. </span><span id="24" class="hide body">I was furious. </span><span id="25" class="hide body">Immediately I spoke to my wife. </span><span id="26" class="hide body">She just replied that no one would believe me since she was small and cute.... </span><span id="27" class="hide body">And she was right... </span><span id="28" class="hide body">Not even the youth protection agencies (I hope they are called like that iin English) cared. </span><span id="29" class="hide body">She knew she could continue abusing my kids and me. </span><span id="30" class="hide body">She knew, </span><span id="31" class="hide body">if I get a divorce she would get the kids and I have to pay for her and the kids for the rest of my life and said that straight to my face. </span><span id="32" class="hide body">So I started to film and foto everything I could. </span><span id="33" class="hide body">To gather even more information, </span><span id="34" class="hide body">I offered her to get a joint calendar app were we both add our appointments. </span><span id="35" class="hide body">Clever as she is, </span><span id="36" class="hide body">she really entered all of her appointments, </span><span id="37" class="hide body">all of her tinder dates, </span><span id="38" class="hide body">all of her orgys and all of her customers appointments in the calendar. </span><span id="39" class="hide body">I played the role of the faithful submissive husband who is too stupid to realize what&apos;s going on.. </span><span id="40" class="hide body">With my lawyer and a recommended detective, </span><span id="41" class="hide body">we started to track her down and made Fotos. </span><span id="42" class="hide body">Then the luck came back to me. </span><span id="43" class="hide body">Her father was sick so my wife went to visit him (she was not from Europe). </span><span id="44" class="hide body">To do that, </span><span id="45" class="hide body">I suggested to take my girls temporarily to my parents in Germany (they were informed) on which she agreed. </span><span id="46" class="hide body">Together with another lawyer we set up some document, </span><span id="47" class="hide body">necessary to sign up the children in school but with some subtle changes she did not notice. </span><span id="48" class="hide body">She and I signed it immediately, </span><span id="49" class="hide body">giving up all custody of the girls to my parents. </span><span id="50" class="hide body">In addition we gathered enough information at that time to go to the court. &#xA0;</span><span id="51" class="hide body">We pressed charges on child abuse, </span><span id="52" class="hide body">child neclection, </span><span id="53" class="hide body">child endangerment (some of the orgys happened in our house while the kids were watching TV), </span><span id="54" class="hide body">domestic violence.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="55" class="hide body">My wife came back and thought she was smart and defended herself instead getting a lawyer herself. </span><span id="56" class="hide body">She did not realize what tsunami rolled towards her. </span><span id="57" class="hide body">When she realized, </span><span id="58" class="hide body">we offered to drop all charges when she signs a contract on OUR condition! </span><span id="59" class="hide body">I get the children, </span><span id="60" class="hide body">I do not owe her anything, </span><span id="61" class="hide body">she is not allowed to see the children unattended (a complete restraint order is not possible here (is that the right term?)), </span><span id="62" class="hide body">no holidays with the children and she has to pay alimonys.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="63" class="hide body">In the meantime I found a new job in Germany and moved back (even this was a heavy hit in my career).</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="64" class="hide body">My now ex wife does not have any European Citizenship even living here for 10years+. </span><span id="65" class="hide body">By signing our divorce papers on our condition, </span><span id="66" class="hide body">she lost her residence permission for Germany and the country we lived in for a couple of years. </span><span id="67" class="hide body">She got the permission to stay a little bit longer to search for work and re-apply for a residence permission which she did. </span><span id="68" class="hide body">But as abusive as she was in the relationship, </span><span id="69" class="hide body">she was not able to adjust herself to a working environment. </span><span id="70" class="hide body">She got fired multiple times until the authorities lost their patience and canceled her welfare status. </span><span id="71" class="hide body">Now she has to pay alimonies, </span><span id="72" class="hide body">is about to lose her residence permission for Europe and is burned for any regular job. &#xA0;</span><span id="73" class="hide body">... &#xA0;</span><span id="74" class="hide body">... &#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span id="75" class="hide body">Yesterday I learned, </span><span id="76" class="hide body">she is a registered prostitute (in her current residence country you must be registered) with her own webpage were you can order her to the hotel (clever as she is, </span><span id="77" class="hide body">with her private telephone number and picture of herself with fully visible face). </span><span id="78" class="hide body">The good thing for her, </span><span id="79" class="hide body">she got a full 4.7 star rating and as far as I can juge from the orgy videos she is quite skillful.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span id="80" class="hide body">P.s. </span><span id="81" class="hide body">Even all this happened, </span><span id="82" class="hide body">I will never tell my daughters anything on their mothers fate, </span><span id="83" class="hide body">nor will I talk bad about her in front of the children.</span></p>
